## What is an Enum, and what are some use cases for them?

An Enum is a strongly typed constants. They allow you to use names that are symbolic which could help you signify your code better to others.

## How can you modify an Enum?

You can change the base value type of the enum by setting it to something thats different. You can also change the starting value of a number by setting the first number in the Enum to the value you want it to start at.

## How have you used Enums in your afternoon lab projects this far?(if you have not yet, give an example of how you could)

I have not yet used Enums for my projects, but it would be simple to use for a library of different items. Using the Enum to store items on it would allow me to reference them with a better name for the overall Enum and items inside of it.
