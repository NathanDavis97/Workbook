## What is a List in C#?

A list is a collection item and can be used for refence types or value types. Thay are more similar to an array or dictionary in java script.

## What List methods seem like you might use them often? Why?

I think I would use the Find all method and Add for most use cases. These allow me to access something in the list or add something into it if the use case requires it.

## How would you retrieve an item from a list? What method could you use?

The easiest way would be to find the item that has a property or matches a property you provide. The Find or Find all would be the best method for this.
