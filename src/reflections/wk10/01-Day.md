## What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?

Value, Reference, and Pointer. Value types store their own data on them while reference types store the location of the acutal information that is stored as data. Pointer types simply point to specific objects.

## What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?

The types are bool, byte, char, decimal, double, enum, float, int, long, sbyte, short, struct, uint, ulong, and ushort. Javascript only uses one version for numbers or strings, where as c# breaks them into different types based off of how much memory they require.

## In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?

Reference types store the location of the object on them so that it can be accessed again later. Value types are that value so they have the data already while reference types are looking towards their data.
