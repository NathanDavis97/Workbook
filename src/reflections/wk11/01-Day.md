## What does Inheritance accomplish for us in C#?

Inheritance allows for classes to recieve methods or functions from a different class. The derived class gets some methods from the base class. It allows us to gain helpful code that we have already written.

## How does Member inheritance work in C#? Does a class inherit all members of the base class?

Inheritance is passed down to each member of the chain. The third member will gain access to both the first and second members while the second member only has access to the first in the chain. You can make a class inherit from another in c# by adding a : and the name of the second class after the first class.

## How does accessibility affect inheritance?

Accessibility directly affects inheritance. If a class is private, a following class will not have access to it.
