## 1. What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?
The idea of accent borders to bring in color is a good one and I think that using small accents would overall make a page look cleaner and still be highly functional at drawing attention. I also appreciate the idea of using different themes for buttons based on what they are meant to do and their hierarchy on the page. This way, the red delete button isnt the first thing that you see, but the grey delete text button is actually the last, since a page could be about creating something instead.

## 2. Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.
This article from Andy Crestodina compiles a fair amount of research on the idea of design and what users will frequently look at as opposed to ignore. He also talks about the type of wording and how long your paragraphs should be in reference to writing, that way your viewers don't get bored or intimidated by the size."https://www.orbitmedia.com/blog/web-design-tips/"

Another article from Vitaly Friedman talks about 10 different principles of web design and what it means for the people using your site. Vitaly talks about what users want and expect, while describing what should be done to keep them on your site for as long as possible.

## 3. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?
Good design can evoke different emotions. Websites could bring out frustration or an angry feeling if it is to cluttered or confusing. Even just looking at a page could be a good experience for a viewer or it could be a bad one based on the layout and design choices. Design could display your proffesional nature, or a kind warm feeling just based off colors alone, and that could be an important selling point from a customer's point of view.
