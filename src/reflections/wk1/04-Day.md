## 1. What is the purpose of wire-framing?

Wire-framing allows for the layout and design of a page to be made before ccoding has to come into play. Wire frames can showcase the design and function of a site which will allow the code to focus on making it come to a reality. By creating  a wireframe, you can worry less about the desing later. It can give insight to the developer and help them maintain a user-focused interface when they are developing.

## 2. What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?

The three levels are low-fidelity, mid-fidelity, and high-fidelity. Low-fidelity tends to be used for brainstorming layouts and design while not getting distracted by perfect design and pixel placement. Mid-fidelity tends to be used to create realistic representations while still avoiding some details that would slow it down, which allows for developers and non developers to see the flow of the page while being semi-accurate. High-fidelity frames may include actual photos or text and will be looking almost exactly like the final product, jsut without the code, which means these should come late in the planning stage.

## 3. Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?

I think that wire-framing can be helpful if you need to come up with a design for a new page. They can definitely be a taxing endeaver, but being able to see what you want it to look like as an end product is a valuable asset. I don't know yet if high-fidelity wire-framing will always be worth it, as it seems like it might just be easier to code it all and see the effects directly after at that point. I do think that if there are just a few changes that would be easy to change it to a high-fidelity frame, then it could be worth it.
