## Why do we use Git?
  
Git is a distributed version control system. This means that git allows us to have a saved copy of code in its entirety both on our local storage and on a remote server. Because we can do this with Git, we are able to work on code and change it on our local storage and then send it to some form of remote storage. We can later take that new version and pull it to a different computer and continue working on it. Git also allows us to keep track of multiple versions of our projects as well as create branches for them.

## The benefits of having multiple branches.

Branches allow for multiple functions or pieces of a project to be worked on at the sime time by mutlitple developers. This allows the individual developers to make their own changes and work on their own code sepereately, without messing with the other developers code. The multiple branches are then able to be merged back together, which allows for the two sets of code to come back to one, with all of the versions and commits of both branches.

## What differentiates Git and Github?

Git allows us to save our projects and code to our local storage and to a remote server. Github is one of the most popular sites that allow you to use Git in tandem with your code. Github allows us to push our projects into their cloud server which backs up our repositories. This allows us to push and fetch code from multiple computers since it is stored in the server on Github.
