## What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?
Planning what you want to have your code accomplish and how you are going to get there is beneficial because you have steps to get to your goal. Simply writing code on a problem that you havent faced before will not be the most helpful because you don't know how to get anywhere close. Even if you dont know how to get to the end goal, you can start with the steps that get you closer. Then you can move on to more diffiuclt problems after that.

## How do you find answers when you are stuck?
I start off by trying to get progress towards the end goal in any way that I can. If I can make a little bit of progress, I can end up making more by following that trian of thought. If I really don't have an idea, I will try to google a solution and make sure I understand it before fully implementing it. Lastly I would ask for help from someone who has encountered the problem.

## from the entire article, what are your biggest takeaways?
My biggest takeaway is that just because something works, doesn't mean that it is correct or the best working code. There are many cases where code might work for some things, but it doesn't work for all of the right things. As we write code, we should be ready to check and test our code to find the simplist solution to the problem.
