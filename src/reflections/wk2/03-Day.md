## What are the main ways to write information to the console? why/when should you use each style?
The main two ways to write to the console are console.log and console.error. Console.log is the most common one as it allows you to help in debugging your functions and console.error will help tell you when you have an error go off.

## Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?
The elements tab allows you to see your HTML, CSS. This allows you to make temporary changes to your CSS or HTML and will be able to see the direct outcome without editing the original file.  


## Outside of writing everything to the consol, what is a better way to debug your code?
By using the debugger in javascript, you can pause your code as it runs. This allows you to follow along with it as it runs and check to see what is working and what is not working. The sources tab on the chrome dev tools also has javascript debugging function that operates in the same way.
