## What is a User Experience? What should be considered when developing a User Experience? 

A user experience is anything that a user would interact with on your app and operating it. You need to consider how the user will use the app or site, not what you simply want them to do. They might use the site differently than you are wanting them to specifically use it, so you have to prepare for that.

## What are some benefits of taking into account the User Experience? 

By creating the user experience from the start, you can create a better flow to your overall page by intergrating good and simple design. You won't have to make as many changes by keeping the user experience in the forefront of the project.

## Why is the User Experience Important? 

Having a good UX will allow your users to potentially come back to your site. If they enjoy using it, they will come back to it and if they are constantly having troubles with it, they probably wont return.
