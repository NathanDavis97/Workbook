## What is Code Documentation? What are some of the ways to document code? 

Code documentation is for when you are passing your code onto another developer who will have to figure out how to use your code. You can use a tutorial to tell them exactly how to use your code, you can use a readme to explain what it is supposed to do and how to work it, or you can comment on the actual code to explain directly how to use the code.

## What are some benefits of Code Documentation? 

Explaining how to use your code allwos the next developer to be able to use your written code with better ease. It allows for them to work better and faster without frustration while allowing you to write better code and learn to explain it in an easier form.

## How important is COde documentation and why? 

Code documentation is important when you are going to be passing off your work to someone else as it benefits everyone to have that documentation. If you aren't passing it on, it is not strictly necessary or required, but it is still important to know why your code is working the way it is and what it is trying to accomplish.
