# Week 7 Day 4
__1/28/2021__

## Which Principles from this weeks reading did you implement?

 We switched off on who did what fairly often and had the person who was weaker at a specific task drive the computer and the stronger person navigate. We also tried to keep our user interface fairly simple without too many options that would be annoying to use.

## What went well?

I feel like my partner and I worked really well together and communicated effectivly while keeping a common goal in mind. We would take turns explaining our ideas on how to complete a goal and try out whichever one we decided would work best, first. 

## What would you do differently?

I would have liked to plan a bit more ahead of time. We ended up having to go back and add a couple of things to our server afterwards since we hadn't thought of it originally.
