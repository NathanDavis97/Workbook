## What is the purpose of Encapsulation?
Encapsulation is used to hold data in a way that it is able to be used and accessed from verying outside sources. It allows for flexibility in the reading of data and processing it in different methods as opposed to being locked into one way.

## WHat were some of the problems with closures and the underscore prefix?
With closures and the underscore prefix, there is a lot of back and forth on whether or not they are the correct ways to make things private. The underscore prefix has become widly known and used, but only marginally protects it from access.

## How do we create private variables in a Es6 class? why would you do this?
By using a constructer in es6, we end up not touching the variables most of the time. The constructer handles the data and creates variables based on the data for us. This also means that we don't have global variables that can be used by peopel outsid of the files.
