## What problem does using Exports solve?
Exporting allows you to have access to other files and give each one a specific responsibility. Exporting also allows for us to declare public variables, functions, and classes by exporting them into other files.

## How does export differ from Export Default?
Export by itself allows you to individually export lines of code and variables. Export default allows you export all of the variables that you have declared in the class as one export.

## What is a benefit of using the Module system?
Modules allow you to split your code efficiently. You get the benefits of debugging with multiple file names, allowing you to effectively find your error. You also get to eradicate more common naming conflicts with multiple files.
