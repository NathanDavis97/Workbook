## In simple terms, what is a sub-document
A subdocuument is a nested document. It is typically spotted when a schema is nested inside of a schema or an object inside of a schema/object.

## When might you use a sub-document/
You might want a sub-document when you need to store information on a single variable or object. This allows you to have tiers of information instead of just a huge number of properties on a single object.

## How do you add to a collection of sub-documents? what about editing them?
To eddit or add, you need to find the document and go into the array by pushing the information into it to add to the array. For editing, you just need to find the array and set the name to something else. After both, you simply need to run a save function.
