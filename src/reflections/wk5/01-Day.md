## What is the purpose of a Query String?
A query string is used to pass information to a website by adding it to the end of a URL. This allows the information to be stored in the string and then read by the website when it reads the URL.

## What is the format of a query parameter? How does it start? How do you distinguish between one parameter and the next? 
A query string is started at the end of the URL by adding a ? to the end. Querys are written in key=value pairs and if you have  more than one parameter, then you seperate them with an & for each pair.

## When do you think Query parameters would be helpful when writing your server?
Query parameters could be helpful when you are writing the server by letting it allow you to check to make sure it works as you are going along by passing it values. Then you can try to pull those values back down to ensure it is working.
