## What is a virtual property?
A virtual property is an aditional fields on a given model. They can be set manually or automatically if your app allows them to be functionally set. 

## When might you use a virtual property?
Using virtuals allow you to creat methods for extra information that is on your object without having to repeat code. They dont exist in the database, the virtual is purely logical.

## How do you search by a virtual properties value?
You are not able to query or use field selection on virtual properties. You can only do that on non-virtual properties.
