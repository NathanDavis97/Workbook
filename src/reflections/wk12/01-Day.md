# Week 12 Day 1
__3/1/2021__

## Working on the Final

Today I started working on the server side. I built out the models and controllers that I was going to need. I also had to think ahead for the many to many relationship that I was going to have to create. I have been thinking through the routes and the relationships over the weekend and feel confident going into the rest of the week.
