## What is component based architecture? 

Component based architecture is when you have your site broken down into individual pieces called components. Each component handles a specific item or function of your page and can be imported into the other components or pages of your app, allowing for specific pieces that are individually controlled. 

## What are some benefits of component based architecture? 

Components are specific, which allow you to use them for exactly what you need and are reusable if you write them correctly. Using CBA also allows your website to be dynamically updated as it gets filled with more or different information from a client. 

## What are some drawbacks of component based architecture? 

The biggest drawback is the tendency to over-engineer the application by making everything its own component as opposed to just building out the app with items when needed. Another potential drawback is that having too many components might end up degrading the ability to use or read your application.
