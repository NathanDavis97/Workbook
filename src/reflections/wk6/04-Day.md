## What is a nested route?

A nested route is a route that is simply nested in another route. It gives you options to extend the way that your site runs by passing it from one page to a subpage that follows part of the same route.

## When might you use a nested route besides the provided example?

You might use a nested route to navigate to multiple pages that are not along the same path, or allow you to navigate to a completely different subset of pages. You could have a button that takes you to a page about purchasing an item, a button that could take you to the product in your cart, or a button that takes you straight to a different product, all because the routes are nested in a parent route.

## Can you pass parameters through nested routes and when might you use it?

Because you are using router links, you should be able to pass down to your child routes the same way you would to a regular route. Passing a prop through would be able to pass the parameters through, for instance, and give them to the child page.
