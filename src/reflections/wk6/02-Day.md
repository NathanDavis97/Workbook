## What are Props? 

Props are unchanging information that is passed to a component. They are not able to be modified and come down from a parent to the component, meaning that they can not travel back upwards to the parent. 

## What are Props used for? 

Props are used to pass information through to components, similar to how functions accept arguments from where they are given them. Props allow the information to be given from the parent page to the component that is being called into the parent page. 

## Where can Props be used or accessed? 

Props can be used or accessed throughout a component. Inside the template, after declaring the prop in the export, you can call the prop information by the propname and a . followed by the key name. In the script part of your component, you will have to access it by calling this. whatever the key name is you are trying to access. This is helpful for passing it through to a function or by calling the information to be displayed on your page.
