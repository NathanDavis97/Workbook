## What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?

Unit Testing, Component testing, and end to end testing. Unit testing tests the smallest pieces of code. Component testing is testing your code in chunks (components). End to End testing is making sure your code is working from the beginning to the end of the program, from codeing to user.

## What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?

I think end to end testing might be the most useful as it represents the user experience. This testing lets you see what your user might do and for you to try to break it with what they might do that they haven't thought of yet.

## What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?

I feel like component testing might be the least useful since it is vue specific. It seems to be most like unit testing anyways, but only applicable toward the vue framework.
