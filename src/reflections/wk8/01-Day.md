## What function does a portfolio provide?

A portfolio serves as a way to display your ability and understanding of programming to other people. It allows you to show off your skill and your passion by giving access to your work. 

## What makes a Developer Portfolio effective?

A good developer portfolio is one that showcases a number of quality projects. There could be 5-6 medium projects or a few big projects, but they should be your cleanest, most polished code. This will allow you to show that you can make quality products and what you have already built.

## What projects do you have that you would include in your portfolio? Why?

I would throw in the Kanban and Blogger because thay are both fully working apps that simply need to be hosted. Those two are the most im interested in posting in a portfolio since they are the most complete and have the best working code.
