## What is an SSL certificate?

An SSL certifacte is a data file that allows for encryption and security for users on websites. You can spot the SSL by the s in https. It is used anywhere that a secure website is asking for information from their user and make it so that hackers cannot interept user data as easily.

## What are the different types of certificates? What are they used for?

The two large branches are encryption and validation, and Domain number certificates with multiple smaller forms under those. The first type, EV, allows you to have encrypted and verified data for your websites so users are sure they are protected, while domain ssl's are only for a specific domain and only provide a moderate amount of security.
