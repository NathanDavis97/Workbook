## How are some ways Scrum for a small team would differ from Scrum with a large team?

Smaller scrum teams need to have better communication in order to effectively progress towards their goal. Meetings might also not take as long in general as there is a smaller number of people etrying to communicate.

## Why does Scrum prescribe to only run 1 sprint at a time.

Having only one sprint at a time allows all of your focus to be on that specific piece of the project instead of getting caught up trying to work in multiple areas at the same time. It allows your entire team to get each piece done in a timely manner while keeping a firm plan to tackle the other parts of the project.
