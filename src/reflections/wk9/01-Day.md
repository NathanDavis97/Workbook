## What technologies and principles are you using in your project?

We used the Google Maps API to allow our users to see points on a map. We tried to follow the Restful principles in order to make our project easy to work with.

## What went well so far?

We were able to find really good and helpful tutorials on how to interact with the API while using vue 3. This allowed us to get a good jumpstart with formatting so we could focus on our functionality more heavily.

## What would you do differently? Why?

I think I would want to have had us switch partners a little bit more. We would have been able to see more of what other people were writing more easily and been able to have a better overall knowledge of the code.
