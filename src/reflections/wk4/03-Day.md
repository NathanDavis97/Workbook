## What is the Purpose of Async/await?
Async/Await is built upon promises and function mostly the same as they are a newer version. They try to fix the problem that chaining promises brings, which is the complexity of the syntax of promise chaining.

## What must you do in order to await a promise inside of a function?
In order to await a promise inside a function, the client function must be declared as async. This allows you to correctly use Async and await to your advantage in a client function.

## what are some of the primary benefits of Async/Await?
The code is easier to read as you do not have to chain promises together. It also allows for multiple async functions at once since they are all waiting for their responses, which also leads to easier debugging as each function is named differently.
