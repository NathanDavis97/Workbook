## What are the three states of a Promes?
The three states of a promise are pending, Resolved, and Rejected. Pending is the initial state before it succeeds or fails, resolved is a completed promise, and rejected is a failed promise.

## How do promises seek to resolve the issues of a "callback hell"? 
Promises allow us to attach callbacks instead of passing them through the whole function. This combined with chaining our promises and callbacks means for much cleaner code than if we were passing each callback.

## what is the differnece between .then() and .catch()
Then is used when a promise is succesful and gives us the correct information we are asking for, which will THEN go to do something else. Catch is used to display something else or run something else if the promise fails.
